## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps: 

`git clone git@github.com:arthurborgesdev/shout.git`

Now there are two main possibilities:

If the project is merged into main:

- Nothing to do, just proceed to the next step, `Prerequisites`

If the project is not merged into main (it is in the mvp-development phase)

- Create mvp-development branch by typing on a Terminal `git checkout -b mvp-development`
- Pull the project to this local branch with the command `git pull origin mvp-development` 
- Ok, now you have the project locally

### Prerequisites

- Ruby 3.x
- Ruby on Rails version 6.x
- Postgres installed (make sure to create databases `shout_development` and `shout_test`)
- Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project with the Cloudinary API KEYS:
  - CLOUDINARY_API_KEY='...'
  - CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET='...'

### Setup

- Run `bundle install` to install ruby and rails dependencies
- Run `yarn` to install the JS dependencies
- Run `rails db:migrate` to migrate the database

It may be necessary to run:

`rails webpacker:install`
`rails assets:clobber`  
`rails webpacker:compile`

To install webpacker and configure the pipeline of assets (Bootstrap + my stylesheet)   

### Usage

- On a separate terminal, run `rails s` to start the server
- Open a browser and access the url `localhost:3000`

### Run tests

To run the tests, run `rspec` or `bundle exec rspec` on a Terminal shell.

## Extra feature

The extra feature of this app is the possibility to remove yells on the userpage of the current logged user. Simple click the blue trash icon!

## Bootstrap and styles

On this project I installed bootstrap with webpacker (that's why my styles are in `app/frontend/packs/application.scss`)

For instructions to how I set it up, please visit [this link](https://bootrails.com/blog/rails-bootstrap-tutorial)
